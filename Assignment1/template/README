The template provided serves to test whether a given implementation of a string matching function works correctly.

Usage intstructions:
	call the test() function (defined in helper.c) with the third parameter as the function you would like to test.
	You must follow the function signature provided in the interface (string_matching.h)
	eg. to test the Boyer Moore function call test as follows
		test(text, pattern, boyerMoore);
	(Make sure you change SIZE defined in helper.h as per requirements)

Compilation instructions:
	gcc -o main.o main.c helper.c string_matching.c

Execution instructions:
	to the run the test from the template folder:
	 ./main.o
	to reduce the size of the input file use:
	  head -c N ../text_file.txt > ../test_file.txt
	( make sure to change the file name in main.c )
